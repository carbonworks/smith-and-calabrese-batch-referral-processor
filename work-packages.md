# S&C Batch Referral Processor — Parallel Work Packages

This file defines independent work packages for parallel agent development. Each package owns specific files to minimize merge conflicts. See `CLAUDE.md` "Parallel Agent Workflow" section for how to run them.

## How to Read This File

- **Status**: `ready` (can start now), `blocked` (dependency not met), `done` (merged to main)
- **Owns**: Files this package creates or heavily modifies. Only one package should own a given file.
- **Reads**: Files the agent needs to reference but should NOT modify.
- **Touches**: Files where this package adds a small, well-scoped change (e.g., a few lines). Merge conflicts here are expected and acceptable.
- **Depends on**: Other packages that must be merged first.

## WP-0: PDF Text Extraction Core — FOUNDATION

**Status:** done
**Owns:** `src/main/kotlin/tech/carbonworks/snc/batchreferralparser/extraction/PdfTextExtractor.kt`, `src/main/kotlin/tech/carbonworks/snc/batchreferralparser/extraction/ExtractionResult.kt`
**Reads:** `reference/python-scripts/extract_referral_fields.py`, `reference/python-scripts/dump_pdf.py`, `docs/field-mapping.json`, `docs/extraction-template.json`, `docs/build-plan.md` (Section 6)
**Touches:** none
**Depends on:** nothing

**Scope:**
Build the core PDF text extraction layer using Apache PDFBox:
1. Create `PdfTextExtractor` — wraps PDFBox `PDFTextStripper` to extract raw text from a PDF file
2. Support coordinate-based text filtering (extract text from specific page regions)
3. Handle multi-page PDFs — extract from all pages, track which page each text block came from
4. Detect pages with no extractable text (flag for OCR fallback later)
5. Create `ExtractionResult` data classes — structured container for extracted text blocks with page number, coordinates, and content
6. Handle common PDF issues: encrypted files (report error), corrupt files (graceful failure), empty pages

**Why this is first:** Every other extraction package needs raw text extraction as its input. Field parsing, table extraction, and the UI all depend on being able to pull text from PDFs.

**Acceptance:** Can open a PDF file, extract text content with positional information, handle errors gracefully. Unit tests cover: normal PDF, multi-page PDF, empty page detection, corrupt file handling.

## WP-1: Field Parsing Engine — Regex & Pattern Matching

**Status:** done
**Owns:** `src/main/kotlin/tech/carbonworks/snc/batchreferralparser/extraction/FieldParser.kt`, `src/main/kotlin/tech/carbonworks/snc/batchreferralparser/extraction/ReferralFields.kt`
**Reads:** `reference/python-scripts/extract_referral_fields.py` (port this logic), `docs/field-mapping.json`, `docs/extraction-template.json`
**Touches:** none
**Depends on:** WP-0 (needs ExtractionResult as input)

**Scope:**
Port the Python field extraction logic to Kotlin:
1. Create `ReferralFields` data class — all target fields from an SSA/DDS referral (claimant name, SSN, DOB, case number, exam type, referring agency, dates, etc.)
2. Create `FieldParser` that takes `ExtractionResult` and produces `ReferralFields`
3. Regex patterns for: SSN (XXX-XX-XXXX), dates (multiple formats), case/claim numbers, names
4. Coordinate-based field identification — use field mapping template to locate fields by position on page
5. Confidence scoring per field — high/medium/low based on pattern match quality
6. Handle missing fields gracefully — extract what's available, flag what's absent

**Acceptance:** Given extracted text from WP-0, produces a populated `ReferralFields` with confidence scores. Handles missing/ambiguous fields without crashing. Regex patterns match the formats in the Python reference script.

## WP-2: Table Extraction — Tabula-java Integration

**Status:** done
**Owns:** `src/main/kotlin/tech/carbonworks/snc/batchreferralparser/extraction/TableExtractor.kt`
**Reads:** `reference/python-scripts/dump_pdf.py`, `docs/build-plan.md` (Section 6)
**Touches:** none
**Depends on:** nothing

**Scope:**
Integrate Tabula-java for structured table data extraction:
1. Create `TableExtractor` — wraps Tabula-java to detect and extract tables from PDF pages
2. Auto-detect table regions on each page
3. Extract cell contents with row/column indices
4. Return structured table data that can feed into field parsing
5. Handle PDFs with no tables (common — not all referrals have tabular data)
6. Handle malformed/partial tables gracefully

**Acceptance:** Can detect tables in PDFs that contain them. Returns structured row/column data. Does not crash on PDFs with no tables. Unit tests cover: PDF with tables, PDF without tables, partial table handling.

## WP-3: XLSX Output — Apache POI Spreadsheet Generation

**Status:** ready
**Owns:** `src/main/kotlin/tech/carbonworks/snc/batchreferralparser/output/SpreadsheetWriter.kt`
**Reads:** `docs/build-plan.md` (Section 10, D2 and D3 specs)
**Touches:** none
**Depends on:** WP-1 (needs ReferralFields data class as input)

**Scope:**
Generate XLSX spreadsheets from extracted referral data:
1. Create `SpreadsheetWriter` that takes a list of `ReferralFields` and writes an XLSX file
2. Column headings matching the field list (one column per field)
3. One row per PDF/referral processed
4. Proper data types — dates as Excel date cells, numbers as numeric cells, strings as text
5. Filename format: `patient-referrals-[date]-[time].xlsx`
6. Output to a caller-specified directory (UI will default to same directory as source PDFs)
7. Google Sheets compatible — no Excel-only features (macros, named ranges, data validation)
8. Include a confidence flag column — mark rows with any low-confidence extractions

**Acceptance:** Produces a valid .xlsx file that opens in Excel and imports cleanly into Google Sheets. Column headings present. Data types correct. Low-confidence rows flagged.

## WP-4: Desktop UI — File Selection & Batch Processing

**Status:** blocked
**Owns:** `src/main/kotlin/tech/carbonworks/snc/batchreferralparser/ui/screens/MainScreen.kt`, `src/main/kotlin/tech/carbonworks/snc/batchreferralparser/ui/screens/ProcessingScreen.kt`, `src/main/kotlin/tech/carbonworks/snc/batchreferralparser/ui/components/`
**Reads:** `docs/build-plan.md` (Sections 10-11), `docs/brand/carbon-works-brand-guidelines.md`
**Touches:** `src/main/kotlin/tech/carbonworks/snc/batchreferralparser/Main.kt` (replace placeholder content with screen navigation)
**Depends on:** WP-0, WP-1, WP-3 (needs extraction pipeline and XLSX output to wire up)

**Scope:**
Build the Compose Desktop UI for the complete batch processing workflow:
1. **MainScreen** — file picker (single or multiple PDFs), drag-and-drop support, "Process" button
2. **ProcessingScreen** — progress display during batch extraction, per-file status
3. **Data preview** — review extracted data in a table before saving to XLSX
4. **Save action** — trigger SpreadsheetWriter, show success/error
5. Batch processing — handle 1-50 PDFs in sequence, one bad PDF doesn't stop the batch
6. CW branding throughout — colors, typography, layout per build plan Section 11
7. Error display — clear messages for unreadable PDFs, missing fields, partial extractions

**Acceptance:** Complete workflow: pick files → extract → preview data → save XLSX. Progress visible during processing. Errors displayed clearly. CW branding applied consistently.

## WP-6: Packaging — jpackage Installer

**Status:** blocked
**Owns:** packaging config in `build.gradle.kts` (jpackage section), installer resources
**Reads:** `docs/build-plan.md` (Section 10, D1 spec)
**Touches:** none
**Depends on:** WP-4 (needs complete, working application to package)

**Scope:**
Create distributable installers:
1. Configure Gradle jpackage task for Windows .msi (bundled JRE, ~60-100MB)
2. Configure Gradle jpackage task for macOS .dmg (secondary target)
3. App icon and installer metadata (CW branding)
4. Verify installer produces a working application on clean machine
5. No "install Java first" requirement — JRE is bundled

**Acceptance:** .msi installs on Windows and runs the application. Bundled JRE — no external Java needed. App icon and window title show CW branding.
